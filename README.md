## Colkie Backend Code Challenge

Colkie is the place where you can join your favorite artist community. We offer many
features, but the most important one is the community channel, where you can connect not
only with many fans around the world but also directly with your idol.
This Channel can be modeled much like a Chat room, and as we are an API first company,
we would like to see how you would model a small API to model a chat like behavior with
several endpoints:
- Create a room
- Add a user to a room
- Send a message to a room
- Get latest messages from a room
